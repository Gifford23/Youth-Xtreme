      <h3 class="text-brand-accent text-xl font-bold mb-2">The Vibe: FOMO & Freedom</h3>
      <p>We've all been there. You feel restricted, watched, and bored. You look at the world and think, "Everyone else is having fun except me." That’s exactly where the younger son was. He didn't just want to leave; he wanted his inheritance <em>now</em>. In that culture, that was basically saying, "Dad, I wish you were dead so I could have your money."</p>
      <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
      <p>He got his wish. He traveled to a "far country" (think Las Vegas with no rules). He spent it all on parties, fake friends, and wild living. It was fun... until the money ran out. Then came the famine. The guy who was buying rounds for everyone was now feeding pigs, wishing he could eat their food. That is the reality of sin: it promises freedom but delivers slavery.</p>
      <h3>The Plot Twist</h3>
      <p>He practiced his apology speech all the way home: "I'll just be a servant." But he didn't know his dad. His father wasn't sitting inside angry; he was <em>waiting</em> on the porch. When he saw his son, he didn't cross his arms; he ran. He threw a robe over his son's shame and threw a party instead of a lecture.</p>

      <h3>Bad Friends & Bad Advice</h3>
      <p>Then his friends showed up. At first, they did the right thing: they sat in silence. But then they opened their mouths. "You must have sinned, Job. God punishes bad people." They were the original trolls. Job felt isolated, misunderstood, and abandoned by God.</p>
      <h3>God Clapback</h3>
      <p>Job demanded answers. "Why me?" And God finally answered... but not with an explanation. He answered with a perspective check. "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation?" God reminded Job that the universe is massive and complex, and maybe, just maybe, God knows what He is doing even when it hurts.</p>

      <h3>The Grind</h3>
      <p>In Egypt, Joseph didn't sulk. He worked. He became the top manager for Potiphar. Then, falsely accused, he got thrown in prison. Did he quit? No. He started organizing the prison. He used his gifts even when no one was watching and no one was paying him.</p>
      <h3>The Palace</h3>
      <p>One dream changed everything. Pharaoh needed answers, and Joseph was ready. In one day, he went from prisoner to Prime Minister. But the real climax wasn't the power; it was when his starving brothers showed up begging for food. He had the power to kill them, but he chose to save them.</p>

He hears the insults and asks, "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"</p>
      <h3>Don't Wear Someone Else's Armor</h3>
      <p>The King tried to put his heavy armor on David. It didn't fit. It looked ridiculous. David took it off. He picked up five smooth stones—weapons he actually knew how to use. Lesson? Be you. God can't use your fake persona; He uses your authentic self.</p>
      <h3>The Shot</h3>
      <p>It wasn't just a lucky shot. It was confidence. David didn't run away; the Bible says he <em>ran quickly toward the battle line</em>. He knew the battle wasn't his to win; it was the Lord's.</p>
